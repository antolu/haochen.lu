    <p>My name is Anton (Hào-chen) Lu, and I'm a M.Sc. student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I'm currently enrolled in a five year degree programme in Engineering Physics (sv: Teknisk Fysik), and am since 2018 pursuing a M.Sc. in Machine Learning, with specialization in deep learning and computation al linguistics. </p>
    <p>My biggest passion is learning new things, whether it be a new problem solving method, a new programming language, a new spoken language, setting up and coding this very website, or how to make cake icing. </p>
